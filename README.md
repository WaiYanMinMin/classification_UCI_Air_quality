# NGDS Assignment 1 – Air Quality ML Pipeline

Note : This is the assignment project for my **Assessment 1** of **Next Generation Data Science** module of **University of Hertfordshire**.
**Python 3.10 is required** for this project because the notebook uses **PyCaret** for AutoML, which needs 3.10.
**Dataset** - UCI airquality (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/360/air+quality)

## How to run

1. **Clone the repo** (or download and extract).

2. **Install Python 3.10 (only if you don’t have it or you use 3.12+):**
   - Download **Python 3.10** from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and run the installer.

3. **Create a virtual environment with Python 3.10 and install dependencies:**
   - go to project root foler.

   ```bash
   py -3.10 -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows
   # source .venv/bin/activate     # Mac/Linux
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Open the notebook:**  
   `notebook/WaiYanMinMin_NGDS_AS1.ipynb`  
   Use the kernel that points to this project’s `.venv` (e.g. in VS Code/Cursor: **Select Kernel** → choose `.venv`).
